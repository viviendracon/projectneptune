# Project NEPTUNE
## Seawater-Based Atmospheric Carbon Capture Initiative

### What is Project NEPTUNE?
Project NEPTUNE is an innovative approach to combat climate change by using Earth's oceans to capture and store atmospheric CO₂. This technology amplifies the ocean's natural carbon absorption process while producing valuable minerals and fresh water as beneficial by-products.

### Why is this Important?
- **Climate Impact**: Capable of removing 5+ billion tonnes of CO₂ annually by 2050 (15% of current emissions)
- **Economic Benefits**: Creates 5-7 million high-skilled jobs globally
- **Resource Generation**: Produces critical minerals for green technology
- **Water Security**: Integrates with desalination for fresh water production
- **Ocean Health**: Helps combat ocean acidification

### How Does it Work?
The system uses deep seawater's natural ability to absorb CO₂, enhanced through engineered processes:
1. Deep cold water is drawn from 200-300m depth
2. Water is exposed to atmospheric air in specialized spray chambers
3. CO₂ is absorbed and converted to stable carbonate minerals
4. Valuable minerals (lithium, magnesium, rare earth elements) are extracted
5. Treated water is returned to the ocean

### Key Advantages
- **Cost Effective**: $17-25 per tonne of CO₂ captured
- **Environmentally Sound**: Uses natural processes, minimal environmental impact
- **Multiple Benefits**: Addresses climate change while producing valuable resources
- **Scalable**: Can be implemented globally at various scales
- **Integration Ready**: Works with existing industrial infrastructure
